			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>Everything in this planet is worth standing in line for.</p>
			<p>. Our people,  after countless tries to reduce the effects of pollution, mass deforestation, over-fishing, and Consumerist greed, Earth had reached its breaking point and the quality of air and water had gotten almost unusable. The Global Initiative Sustainability and Restoration Act of 2047 was enacted and signed by the remaining global leaders, effectively the beginning of world peace. </p>
			<p>Through efforts made to reduce carbon and methane in the atmosphere using obligate symbiosis techniques learned through the natural order, emissions are at a 20 year low and phase one of Big Little Blue is in effect! In as little as one hundred years we may be able to sustain planet-wide vegetation growth!</p>

			<h2>How to get here</h2>
			<p><strong>Craft: </strong>Flights around earth are strictly for military and government use only due to lack of physical resources. We expect to have fleets of craft in the air shortly.</p>
			<p><strong>Car: </strong>If you have access to a working motor vehicle we suggeest carpooling to the Leonidas Facility. Also, have your combustible engine vehicles converted to hydrogen fueled vehicles free of charge! Please allow 3-5 weeks for servicing.</p>
			<p><strong>Horseback: </strong>Stalls are available for those arriving via horseback. From the ashes of the global revolution rose the phoenix that became Project Big Little Blue and the last opportunity for survival of the remaining human race. </p>
